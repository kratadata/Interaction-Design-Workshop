# Interaction-Design-Workshop
LET'S GET PHYSICAL | Warsaw March 2022



# Abstract
How can we imagine new ways of taking control over the software? Can we devise a better
controller than a mouse? This workshop introduces the possibilities of bi-directional
control of web-based programs via DIY electronic devices. It asks to rethink and re-design
new ways of interacting with a browser using analogue electronics components, and self
written code.


# Objectives
The course introduces the basics of creative coding in p5.js and Arduino prototyping
platform. Using graphical user interface elements, like sliders, or buttons, students will learn 
how to prototype with electronics. Furthermore, they will explore how to creatively think about daily
technology and create narratives around it.

At the end of the workshops the participants will build a bi-directional communication between a Webbrowser and Arduino using:
- p5.js based sketch
- Arduino based controller
  
During the presentation the participants will show their programmes and interact with them.
